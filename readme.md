I hate creating new controllers, middlewares, ... by copy & paste. Wouldn't it be cool to have all the `make` commands you use in your daily Laravel app development workflow also for developing new packages? This package was created solely for the purpose to make package development as fast and easy as possible. Creating a new package only takes one command (`make:package`) and you will end up with the following file structure:

```bash

<a name="internals-create"/>

### Create a package
```
php artisan make:package
```

![make:package](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10154100/44323501-89bdf000-a452-11e8-8fc4-3ec5c451c30a.gif)

<a name="internals-nova"/>

### Create a nova tool
```
php artisan make:nova
```

Inspired by [Spatie's nova-skeleton-tool](https://github.com/spatie/skeleton-nova-tool) this command clones the repository, replaces all strings with your own and adds it to your own project.

![make:nova](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10154100/44515270-5d100f80-a6c2-11e8-9a8c-a26e9a3af55d.png)

<a name="internals-add"/>

### Add a package
```
php artisan package:add
```
If you have already created a package or you want to add a modified version of a package which is currently only available locally, you can use the following command to add you package to your project. It does simply add your package to your project`s composer repositories and requires a local version of it.

**This command is run by `make:package` automatically, so you have no need to execute it after creating a package!**

<a name="internals-save"/>

### Save package credentials
```
php artisan package:save
				{namespace : Root namespace of the package (Vendor\Package_name)}
				{path : Relative path to the package's directory}
```
Every `package:*` command needs to know the package's *namespace* and the relative *path* to the location your package is stored. Because of that every `package:*` command comes with those two options by default. To avoid entering those two options every time a `package:*` command executed this command saves the credentials of your package in the cache.

<a name="internals-delete"/>

### Delete package credentials
```
php artisan package:delete
```
This one wipes all stored credentials from your cache.

<a name="internals-clone"/>

### Clone a package
```
php artisan package:clone
                {src : Source path of the package to clone}
                {target : Path where it should be cloned in}
```
The clone command clones a given repository or directory into the given target.

<a name="internals-replace"/>

### Replace Content
```
php artisan package:replace 
                {path : The path to a file or directory}
                {--O|old=* : Old strings which will be replaced}
                {--N|new=* : New strings which will be used as replacement}'
```
The replace command takes a path of a file or a directory and an indefinite number of 'old' options which will be replaced by the 'new' options.
